# **About Me**  

I am a **Computational Biologist** with a strong background in **Bioinformatics** and a passion for understanding immune systems at the single-cell level. My work spans multiple species and research institutions, focusing on **transcriptomics and genomics** across different biological models.

## **Research Experience**  

### 🔬 Zebrafish Bulk-RNA Sequencing  
**Institute of Anatomy, [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html)**  
Explored gene expression patterns in zebrafish to advance anatomical and developmental biology research.  

### 🧬 Single-Cell Omics & Genomics  
**[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)**  
Worked on **human and mouse single-cell omics** and **Drosophila genomics**, uncovering insights into cellular diversity and genetic regulation.  

### 🐾 Immunology of Non-Model Species  
**Vetsuisse Faculty, Institute of Virology and Immunology (University of Bern), [IVI](https://www.ivi.unibe.ch/forschung/immunologie/gruppe_talker/projekte/index_ger.html)**  
Currently investigating the **Mononuclear Phagocyte System (MPS)** at the single-cell level across various **non-model domestic species**, deepening our understanding of species-specific immune mechanisms.
