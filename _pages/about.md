{% include base_path %}

I am a computational epidemiologist and head of the [Interfaculty Platform for Data and Computational Science (INPUT)](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/research/research_groups/input/index_eng.html) at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch) at the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch), Switzerland.

A major focus of my research concerns how the population biology of infectious diseases is affected by public health interventions, dynamic patterns of host immunity, and environmental changes.
