### Comparisons of RNA-seq data from *Danio rerio* heart injury models

The workflow established to analyze the RNA-seq gathered data can be understand as a data processing pipeline that cleans variables not related to the biological question of interest and adds information to the genes (data of interest) obtained after the analysis in order to end up with a Biological Interpretation.

The Biological Interpretation is helped by multiple visualizations such as Integrated Networks realized with Gene Ontologies obtained through use of diverse tools.

The *R* code files that were used for this analysis will be found on <a href="https://github.com/j">GitHub</a> **after data is published (soon)**.


### small RNA-seq species data from *Danio rerio* analysis

Capture the micro, piwi, tRNA, rRNA and more to add species to the workflow established using remote resources via SLURM.



### Variant Calling for  RNA-seq data from *Danio rerio* for capturing the Haplotypes involved

Metabolic disturbances it is believed could arise from variants affecting the mitochondrions in charge of the energy supply of the cell and altering completely the organism.


### Machine Learning classification project

Multiple small projects for learning to use the algorithms and the requirements for them to apply them to data.
Mostly using python with keras and tensorflow.
