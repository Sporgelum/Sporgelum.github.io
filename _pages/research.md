### Comparisons of RNA-seq data from *Danio rerio* heart injury models.

The workflow established to analyze the RNA-seq gathered data can be understand as a data processing pipeline that cleans variables not related to the biological question of interest and adds information to the genes (data of interest) obtained after the analysis in order to end up with a Biological Interpretation.

The Biological Interpretation is helped by multiple visualizations such as Integrated Networks realized with Gene Ontologies obtained through use of diverse tools.

The *R* code files that were used for this analysis will be found on <a href="https://github.com/j">GitHub</a> **after data is published (soon)**.
